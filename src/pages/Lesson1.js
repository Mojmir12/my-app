      <h2>Introduction to Metal Stamping</h2>
      <p>
        Metal stamping is a manufacturing process used to convert flat metal sheets into specific shapes. 
        It is a complex process that can include a number of metal forming techniques such as blanking, punching, bending, and piercing.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is Metal Stamping Important?</h3>
      <p>
        Metal stamping is crucial in industries like automotive, aerospace, and electronics, where large volumes of parts need to be produced with precision and efficiency.
      </p>
      <h3>Steps in Metal Stamping</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing the tooling (dies)</li>
        <li>Cutting or punching the metal sheet</li>
        <li>Forming the desired shape through stamping</li>
        <li>Finishing processes such as cleaning or polishing</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Materials and Tools</h3>
      <p>
        The most common materials used in stamping are steel, aluminum, and copper. The tools include punches, dies, and presses.
