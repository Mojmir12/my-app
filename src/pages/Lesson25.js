      <h2>Transfer Stamping</h2>
      <p>
        Transfer stamping is a process in which metal blanks are transferred through multiple die stations, 
        each performing a different operation. The transfer is typically done using mechanical fingers or 
        other automated systems, allowing the blank to move from one station to the next for progressive shaping and forming.

      <h3>1. Key Features of Transfer Stamping</h3>
      <p>
        One of the key features of transfer stamping is its ability to handle larger and more complex parts 
        than progressive die stamping. The transfer process allows the part to be manipulated between each station, 
        which is essential for producing parts that require multiple forming or bending operations.

      <h3>2. Advantages of Transfer Stamping</h3>
      <p>
        Transfer stamping is especially suitable for large parts or when multiple complex operations are required. 
        The flexibility of this process allows for intricate designs and deep drawing, which can be difficult to 
        achieve with other stamping methods.

      <h3>3. Applications of Transfer Stamping</h3>
      <p>
        Transfer stamping is commonly used in the automotive industry, particularly for the production of large parts 
        like car body panels, doors, and hoods. It is also used in the production of complex metal components for 
        other industries such as aerospace and heavy machinery.

      <h3>4. Challenges in Transfer Stamping</h3>
      <p>
        One of the main challenges in transfer stamping is the complexity of tooling and die setup. Each station 
        must be precisely calibrated to ensure accurate results, and the transfer mechanism must be synchronized 
        with the movement of the parts.
